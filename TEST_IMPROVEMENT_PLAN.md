# Yggdrasil Test Suite Improvement Plan

## 📋 Implementation Tracking Document

**Started**: 2025-08-15  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS  
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Setup

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This file tracks all test improvements. Update after each step to enable safe restarts.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Add frontend component testing (currently 0% coverage)
2. Eliminate test duplication (~20% overlap identified)
3. Standardize test configurations across services
4. Implement coverage gates (target: 80% minimum)
5. Add performance and contract testing

---

## 📊 Current State Baseline

- **Total Tests**: ~2,600 (109 E2E + 2,500+ unit/integration)
- **Frontend Coverage**: <10% ❌
- **Backend Coverage**: ~75% ✅
- **Test Execution Time**: ~35 minutes (full suite)
- **Duplicate Areas**: Auth (3x), User CRUD (2x), News (4x)

---

## 🛠️ Implementation Phases

### ✅ Phase 0: Safety Preparations

- [x] Create backup branch: `git checkout -b test-improvements-backup`
- [x] Run full test suite to establish baseline
- [x] Document current test times and pass rates
- [ ] Create rollback script

**Commands**:

```bash
# Baseline test run
npm run test:quiet > test-baseline-$(date +%Y%m%d).log 2>&1
npm run test --workspaces > jest-baseline-$(date +%Y%m%d).log 2>&1
```

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
**Notes**:

- Backup branch created: `test-improvements-backup`
- Jest tests have MongoDB connection issues (expected, will fix during implementation)
- Playwright tests functional but need cleanup

---

### ⚠️ CRITICAL CORRECTION: NO MOCKS POLICY

**IMPORTANT**: All tests must use REAL data and REAL services. No mocking allowed!

- ❌ FORBIDDEN: Mock functions, mock data, jest.mock()
- ✅ REQUIRED: Real backend services, real database, real authentication
- ✅ REQUIRED: TestDataFactory for creating real test data

### 📦 Phase 1: Frontend Testing Setup (Week 1, Part 1)

#### Step 1.1: Add React Testing Library

- [x] Install testing dependencies in frontend package
- [x] Configure Jest for Next.js
- [x] Create test setup files
- [x] Verify configuration works

**Commands**:

```bash
cd packages/frontend
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest-environment-jsdom @swc/jest @types/jest
```

**Files Created**:

- `packages/frontend/jest.config.js` ✅
- `packages/frontend/jest.setup.js` ✅
- `packages/frontend/__mocks__/styleMock.js` ✅
- `packages/frontend/__mocks__/fileMock.js` ✅

**Verification**:

```bash
npm run test --workspace=@yggdrasil/frontend
```

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Issues**: None  
**Notes**:

- Successfully configured Jest with Next.js
- Created first test for Sidebar component (6 tests passing)
- Fixed import issues (named vs default exports)

---

#### Step 1.2: Create First Component Tests

- [x] Test Navigation component (Sidebar)
- [x] Test StatCard component
- [x] Test LoadingState components
- [ ] Test Dashboard components
- [ ] Test Course components

**Files Created**:

```
packages/frontend/__tests__/
├── components/
│   ├── Sidebar.test.tsx      ✅ (6 tests)
│   ├── StatCard.test.tsx     ✅ (10 tests)
│   └── LoadingState.test.tsx ✅ (19 tests)
```

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Coverage**: Frontend testing infrastructure established
**Test Count**: 35 tests passing
**Notes**:

- Successfully created 3 comprehensive component test suites
- All 35 tests passing without issues
- Ready to expand coverage to more components

---

### 🔄 Phase 1.5: Refactor Testing Strategy (CRITICAL CORRECTION)

**REALIZATION**: Jest is wrong tool for complex integration tests. Yggdrasil pattern is:

- **Playwright**: Real services, real data, complete user journeys ✅
- **Jest**: Pure functions, utilities, API schemas ✅

#### Step 1.5.1: Refocus Jest on Pure Functions

- [x] Remove complex component tests from Jest
- [x] Focus Jest on utilities and pure functions
- [x] Create example test for `lib/utils/cn.ts`
- [ ] Test API response schemas
- [ ] Test validation functions
- [ ] Test helper utilities

**New Jest Test Focus**:

- `lib/utils/cn.ts` - Class name utility ✅ (19 tests)
- `lib/validation/` - Schema validation functions
- `lib/auth/tokenUtils.ts` - Pure auth utilities
- `lib/api/responseHelpers.ts` - API response formatters

**Status**: ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY
**Example**: `cn.test.ts` - 19 tests passing, pure function testing

---

#### Step 1.5.2: Enhance Playwright Tests Instead

- [ ] Add more component integration to existing Playwright suites
- [ ] Focus on real user workflows with components
- [ ] Test component behavior with real authentication
- [ ] Use existing TestDataFactory and real services

**Enhancement Areas**:

- Sidebar behavior with different user roles (in User Management suite)
- Dashboard components with real data (in Platform Core suite)
- Course components with real courses (in Course Learning suite)

**Status**: ⏳ PENDING - Focus here instead of Jest

---

### 🔧 Phase 2: Standardize Configurations (Week 1, Part 2)

#### Step 2.1: Create Shared Jest Config

- [ ] Create base Jest configuration
- [ ] Update all service configs to extend base
- [ ] Standardize coverage settings
- [ ] Verify all services still pass

**Files to Create**:

- `jest.config.base.js` (root level)

**Files to Update**:

- All `jest.config.js` files in services

**Verification**:

```bash
npm run test --workspaces
```

**Status**: ⏳ NOT STARTED  
**Issues**: None  
**Rollback**: Restore individual jest.config.js files

---

#### Step 2.2: Unify Test Scripts

- [ ] Standardize test script names
- [ ] Add coverage scripts
- [ ] Add watch mode scripts
- [ ] Update CI/CD scripts

**Pattern**:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "test:ci": "jest --ci --coverage --maxWorkers=2"
  }
}
```

**Status**: ⏳ NOT STARTED  
**Issues**: None

---

### 🧹 Phase 3: Remove Duplicates (Week 2, Part 1)

#### Step 3.1: Audit Duplicate Tests

- [x] Map auth test coverage across all files
- [x] Map user CRUD test coverage
- [x] Map news service test coverage
- [x] Create deduplication plan

**Analysis Results**:

- Found 6 mock-based controller/service tests that duplicate real data tests
- Identified appropriate pure function tests to keep
- Distinguished between legitimate utility tests vs. mock-heavy duplicates

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

---

#### Step 3.2: Consolidate Tests

- [x] Keep E2E for user journeys only
- [x] Keep functional tests for API contracts
- [x] Remove redundant mock-based unit tests
- [x] Verify coverage maintained

**Files Removed** (Mock-based duplicates):

```bash
packages/api-services/news-service/__tests__/unit/NewsController.test.ts
packages/api-services/statistics-service/__tests__/unit/StatisticsController.test.ts
packages/api-services/course-service/__tests__/unit/controller.test.ts
packages/api-services/planning-service/__tests__/unit/PromotionCrudController.test.ts
packages/api-services/auth-service/__tests__/unit/AuthService.test.ts
packages/api-services/user-service/__tests__/unit/UserService.test.ts
packages/api-services/statistics-service/__tests__/unit/StatisticsService.test.ts
```

**Files Kept** (Real data or pure functions):

- All functional/integration tests (use real databases)
- Pure utility tests (JWT, validation, role checking)
- Stress/edge case tests

**Verification**:

```bash
# Before: ~24 API service tests
# After: 17 API service tests
# Reduction: ~29% while maintaining real data coverage
```

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Result**: Eliminated mock-based tests, preserved real data testing

---

### 📝 Phase 4: Add Contract Testing (Week 2, Part 2)

#### Step 4.1: Setup Contract Testing Infrastructure

- [x] Install OpenAPI test dependencies (ajv, ajv-formats, axios)
- [x] Create ContractTester utility class
- [x] Export ContractTester from shared-utilities
- [x] Create comprehensive schema validation system

**Dependencies Added**:

```bash
# ajv and ajv-formats already in shared-utilities devDependencies
# axios for HTTP requests, openapi-types for TypeScript support
```

**Files Created**:

- `packages/shared-utilities/src/testing/ContractTester.ts` ✅ (237 lines)
