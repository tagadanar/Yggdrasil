## Summary
- Total Tests: 42
- Failed Tests: 42
- Success Rate: 0%

## Root Cause Analysis
All test failures stem from authentication issues:
- Primary Error: "Invalid email or password" (401 Unauthorized)
- Secondary Error: Navigation timeouts after failed login attempts
- Tertiary Error: Element interaction failures due to page state issues

## Critical Issues Identified
1. **Authentication Service Issue**: Test users are not being properly authenticated
2. **Test User Creation**: Generated test users may not exist in database or have incorrect credentials
3. **Password Hashing**: Mismatch between test user passwords and authentication service expectations
4. **Service Connectivity**: Potential issues with auth service (port 3001) communication

## Recommended Fix Priority
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix authentication service for test users
2. **HIGH**: Verify test user database seeding process
3. **HIGH**: Validate password hashing consistency
4. **MEDIUM**: Review service startup and connectivity

## Next Steps
1. Investigate authentication service logs
2. Verify test user creation process
3. Check database state for test users
4. Validate service health and connectivity
