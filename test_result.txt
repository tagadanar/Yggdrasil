🚀 Smart Test Runner - Two-Phase Testing Strategy
🎯 Optimization: Only failed tests from Phase 1 are retried in Phase 2
⚡ This avoids redundant execution of tests that already passed
Optimizing for both speed and accuracy...


🏁 PHASE 1: Parallel Discovery (Fast Feedback)
Running all tests with 4 workers to identify issues...
🛑 Stopping existing services...

🔄 Stop service manager...
⚠️  Stop service manager completed with failures (0.0s)

🔄 Stop ts-node-dev processes...
⚠️  Stop ts-node-dev processes completed with failures (0.0s)

🔄 Stop Next.js dev server...
⚠️  Stop Next.js dev server completed with failures (0.0s)

🔄 Parallel test execution (4 workers)...
⚠️  Parallel test execution (4 workers) completed with failures (145.5s)

📊 Phase 1 Results:
   ✅ Passed: 36
   ❌ Failed: 94
   ⏭️  Skipped: 0
   🚫 Did not run: 12

🔄 PHASE 2: Sequential Retry (Accurate Results)
📊 Phase 1 Summary: 36 passed, 94 failed
⚡ Optimization: Only retrying 94 failed tests (skipping 36 passed tests)
   🔐 Auth-related failures: 7
   🔧 Business logic failures: 87
