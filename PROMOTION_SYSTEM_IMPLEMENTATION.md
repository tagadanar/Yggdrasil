- [x] Documented all enrollment-related components
- [x] Designed new promotion system architecture
- [x] Created implementation plan document
- [x] Requirements clarified

### âœ… Implementation Phase
- [x] Phase 1: Database & Models âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Phase 2: Backend Services âœ… COMPLETED  
- [x] Phase 3: Frontend Components âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Phase 3B: Attendance Tracking System âœ… COMPLETED (Added comprehensive attendance tracking with 70%/30% progress formula)

## Overview

### System Requirements (Clarified)
- **One Promotion Per Student**: Each student belongs to exactly one promotion
- **Semester-Based**: Promotions start in September or March
- **10 Semesters**: Full curriculum spans 10 semesters (5 years)
- **Course Access**: Students can access course materials anytime once linked via promotion
- **Admin/Staff Only**: Only admin & staff can create/modify promotions
- **Teacher Assignment**: Teachers are assigned to events containing their courses
- **Mid-Semester Joins**: Students joining mid-semester get all promotion events
- **No Rollback**: Complete removal of enrollment system - no backwards compatibility

## Current Enrollment System Components to Remove

### Database Models
1. **CourseEnrollment Model** (`packages/database-schemas/src/models/CourseEnrollment.ts`)
   - CourseEnrollmentDocument
   - CourseEnrollmentModel
   - ExerciseSubmissionModel (keep, but link to promotion)

2. **EnrollmentData Model** (`packages/database-schemas/src/models/EnrollmentData.ts`)
   - EnrollmentDataDocument
   - ProgressDocument (keep, but link to promotion)
   - SubmissionDocument (keep, but link to promotion)

### API Endpoints & Services
1. **Course Service** (`packages/api-services/course-service/src/services/CourseService.ts`)
   - `enrollStudent()` method
   - `getStudentEnrollments()` method
   - `getCourseEnrollments()` method
   - Enrollment-related stats updates

2. **Course Controller** (`packages/api-services/course-service/src/controllers/CourseController.ts`)
   - Enrollment endpoints

3. **Course Routes** (`packages/api-services/course-service/src/routes/courseRoutes.ts`)
   - POST `/courses/:courseId/enroll`
   - GET `/courses/:courseId/enrollments`
   - GET `/students/:studentId/enrollments`

### Frontend Components
1. **Course List** (`packages/frontend/src/components/courses/CourseList.tsx`)
   - Enrollment buttons
   - Enrollment status display

2. **Course Detail** (`packages/frontend/src/components/courses/CourseDetail.tsx`)
   - Enrollment actions
   - Enrollment status

3. **Student Dashboard** (`packages/frontend/src/components/dashboard/StudentDashboard.tsx`)

   - `packages/testing-utilities/tests/reorganized/08-system-integration/`
   - Course service unit tests
   - Database schema tests

## New Promotion System Architecture

### Database Models

#### 1. Promotion Model
```typescript
interface Promotion {
  _id: string;
  name: string; // e.g., "Web Development 2024 - Group A"
  description?: string;
  academicYear: string; // e.g., "2024-2025"
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  students: mongoose.Types.ObjectId[]; // User references
  events: mongoose.Types.ObjectId[]; // Event references
  createdBy: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'completed' | 'archived';
  metadata: {
    level?: string;
    department?: string;
    maxStudents?: number;
  };
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

#### 2. PromotionMembership Model
```typescript
interface PromotionMembership {
  _id: string;
  promotionId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  studentId: mongoose.Types.ObjectId;
  joinedAt: Date;
  leftAt?: Date;
  status: 'active' | 'inactive' | 'graduated' | 'dropped';
  progress: {
    eventsAttended: string[];
    coursesCompleted: string[];
    overallProgress: number;
  };
}
```

#### 3. Modified Event Model
- Keep existing Event model
- Ensure `linkedCourse` field works properly
- Add `promotionId` field to link events to promotions

#### 4. Modified Progress/Submission Models
- Replace `enrollmentId` with `promotionMembershipId`
- Keep tracking by course but within promotion context

### API Structure

#### Promotion Service Endpoints
1. **Admin/Staff Routes**:
   - POST `/promotions` - Create promotion
   - PUT `/promotions/:id` - Update promotion
   - DELETE `/promotions/:id` - Delete promotion
   - POST `/promotions/:id/students` - Add students
   - DELETE `/promotions/:id/students/:studentId` - Remove student
   - POST `/promotions/:id/events` - Add events to promotion calendar
   - GET `/promotions/:id/calendar` - Get promotion calendar

2. **Student Routes**:
   - GET `/students/promotions` - Get my promotions
   - GET `/promotions/:id/calendar` - View promotion calendar
   - GET `/promotions/:id/courses` - Get courses through events

3. **Common Routes**:
   - GET `/promotions` - List promotions (filtered by role)
   - GET `/promotions/:id` - Get promotion details

### Frontend Changes

#### New Components
1. **PromotionManagement** (Admin/Staff)
   - Create/Edit promotion form
   - Student assignment interface
   - Calendar management

2. **PromotionCalendar**
   - View promotion events

   - Access promotion calendar
   - View courses through events

#### Modified Components
1. **StudentDashboard**
   - Replace "My Enrollments" with "My Promotions"
   - Show promotion calendar
   - Course access through events

2. **CourseList**
   - Remove enrollment buttons for students
   - Show courses only through promotion events

3. **CourseDetail**
   - Access controlled by promotion membership
   - No direct enrollment option

## Questions to Clarify

1. **Promotion Structure**:
   - Should promotions have sub-groups?
   - Can a student be in multiple promotions simultaneously?
   - How to handle students changing promotions?

2. **Course Access**:
   - Can students access course materials outside scheduled events?
   - Should there be restrictions on when course content is available?
   - How to handle make-up classes or missed events?

3. **Progress Tracking**:
   - How to calculate progress without direct enrollment?
   - Should progress be tracked per promotion or per course?
   - How to handle students who join promotions late?

4. **Permissions**:
   - Can teachers create promotions or only admin/staff?
   - Who can modify promotion calendars?
   - Can students view other promotions' calendars?

5. **Historical Data**:
   - How to migrate existing enrollments to promotions?
   - Should we keep historical enrollment data?
   - How to handle in-progress courses during migration?

## Migration Strategy

### Data Migration
1. Create default promotion for existing enrolled students
2. Map enrollments to promotion memberships
3. Link existing course progress to promotions
4. Preserve submission history

### Rollback Plan
1. Keep enrollment models temporarily disabled
2. Feature flag for promotion system
3. Ability to switch back if issues arise
4. Backup all data before migration

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Promotion CRUD operations
- Membership management
- Calendar integration
- Progress tracking

### Integration Tests
- Promotion-Event-Course flow
- Student access control
- Progress calculation
- Statistics aggregation

### E2E Tests
- Complete student workflow
- Admin promotion management
- Calendar navigation
- Course access through events

## Success Criteria

1. All students assigned to promotions
2. Course access only through promotion events
3. No direct enrollment capability
4. Calendar-based course scheduling
5. Proper progress tracking
6. All tests passing
7. No regression in other features

## Notes & Decisions

- **Decision**: Keep exercise submissions linked to courses but accessed through promotions
- **Decision**: Maintain course structure, only change access method
- **Note**: Consider future features like promotion templates
- **Note**: May need bulk operations for large promotions
